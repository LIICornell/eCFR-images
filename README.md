# eCFR-images

The Code of Federal Regulations contains more than 15,000 images of varying quality. resource.org has already converted 1122 images into MathML (formulae) and SVG (diagrams) - see https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/cfr.graphics/. This project will first convert the rest of the formulae and diagrams. It will also track sourcing for images that reflect data available elsewhere in machine-readable format.
