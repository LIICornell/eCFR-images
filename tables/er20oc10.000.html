<p>The cumulative effect of fees and expenses can substantially reduce the growth of your retirement savings. Visit the Department of Labor’s Web site for an example showing the long-term effect of fees and expenses at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/401k employee.html. Fees and expenses are only one of many factors to consider when you decide to invest in an option. You may also want to think about whether an investment in a particular option, along with your other investments, will help you achieve your financial goals.</p>

<h3>Part III. Annuity Information</h3>

<p>Table 4 focuses on the annuity options under the plan. Annuities are insurance contracts that allow you to receive a guaranteed stream of payments at regular intervals, usually beginning when you retire and lasting for your entire life. Annuities are issued by insurance companies. Guarantees of an insurance company are subject to its long-term financial strength and claims-paying ability.</p>
