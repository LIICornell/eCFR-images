For circling approaches, all tests apply to the runway used for the initial approach and to the runway of intended landing. If all runways in an airport model used to meet the requirements of this attachment are not designated as "in-use," then the "in-use" runways must be listed on the SOQ (e.g., KORD, Rwys 9R, 14L, 22R). Models of airports with more than one runway must have all significant runways not "in-use" visually depicted for airport and runway recognition purposes. The use of white or off white light strings that identify the runway threshold, edges, and ends for twilight and night scenes are acceptable for this requirement. Rectangular surface depictions are acceptable for daylight scenes. A visual system's capabilities must be balanced between providing airport models with an accurate representation of the airport and a realistic representation of the surrounding environment. Airport model detail must be developed using airport pictures, construction drawings and maps, or other similar data, or developed in accordance with published regulatory material; however, this does not require that such models contain details that are beyond the design capability of the currently qualified visual system. Only one "primary" taxi route from parking to the runway end will be required for each "in-use" runway.</span></td>

<td headers="begininfo qualifications entry3">An example of being able to combine two airport models to achieve two "in-use" runways: One runway designated as the "in-use" runway in the first model of the airport, and the second runway designated as the "in-use" runway in the second model of the same airport. For example, the clearance is for the ILS approach to Runway 27, Circle to Land on Runway 18 right. Two airport visual models might be used: the first with Runway 27 designated as the "in-use" runway for the approach to Runway 27, and the second with Runway 18 Right designated as the "in-use" runway. When the pilot breaks off the ILS approach to Runway 27, the instructor may change to the second airport visual model in which Runway 18 Right is designated as the "in-use" runway, and the pilot would make a visual approach and landing. This process is acceptable to the FAA as long as the temporary interruption due to the visual model change is not distracting to the pilot, does not cause changes in navigational radio frequencies, and does not cause undue instructor/evaluator time.</td>
