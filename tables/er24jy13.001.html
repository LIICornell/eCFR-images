<td headers="irs1040">Capital Gain and Losses (from Schedule D)</td>
<td headers="description">Capital gains or losses generally occur only one time, and should not be considered when determining effective income. However, if the individual has a constant turnover of assets resulting in gains or losses, the capital gain or loss must be considered when determining the income. Three years' tax returns are required to evaluate an earning trend. If the trend:
<ul>
<li>&#8226; Results in a gain, it may be added as effective income, or </li>
<li>&#8226; Consistently shows a loss, it must be deducted from the total income.  </li>
</ul>
Creditor must document anticipated continuation of income through verified assets.<br />
<em>Example</em>: A creditor can consider the capital gains for an individual who purchases old houses, remodels them, and sells them for profit.
