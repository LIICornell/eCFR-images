              Note. 1 — Testing of position versus force is not applicable if forces are generated solely
              by use of airplane hardware in the FTD.<br />
              Note 2 — Pitch, roll and yaw controller position versus force or
              time should be measured at the control. An alternative method in lieu of external lest fixtures at the
              flight controls would be to have recording and measuring instrumentation built into the FTD. The force and
              position data from this instrumentation could be directly recorded and matched to the airplane data.
              Provided the instrumentation was verified by using external measuring equipment while conducting the
              static
              control checks, or equivalent means, and that evidence of the satisfactory comparison is included in the
              MQTG. the instrumentation could be used for both initial and recurrent evaluations for the measurement of
              all required control checks. Verification of the instrumentation by using external measuring equipment
              should be repeated if major modifications and/or repairs are made to the control loading system. Such a
              permanent installation could be used without any time being lost for the installation of external devices.
              Static and dynamic flight control tests should be accomplished at the same feel or impact pressures as the
              validation data where applicable.<br />
              Note 3 — (Level 7 FTD only) FTD static control testing from the second set
              of pilot controls is only required if both sets of controls are not mechanically interconnected on the
              FTD.
              A rationale is required from the data provider if a single set of data is applicable to both sides. If
              controls are mechanically interconnected in the FTD. a single set of tests is sufficient.
