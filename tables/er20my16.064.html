Procedure: With the simulated airplane trimmed in 1 g flight while at high altitude, increase the engine power so that the Mach number exceeds the documented value at which Mach buffet is experienced. Check that the buffet begins at the same Mach number as it does in the airplane (for the same configuration) and that buffet levels are representative of the actual airplane. For certain airplanes, maneuver buffet can also be verified for the same effects. Maneuver buffet can occur during turning flight at conditions greater than 1 g, particularly at higher altitudes.</td>

Procedure: Tail-strikes can be checked by over-rotation of the airplane at a speed below V<sub>r</sub> while performing a takeoff. The effects can also be verified during a landing.<br /><br />
