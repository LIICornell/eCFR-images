                            oral or nasal route, or stoma route with sterile technique. Attempts
                            should be made to observe a resident being suctioned should such an
                            opportunity arise. If so, observe that a clean/aseptic technique is
                            observed throughout and that the resident tolerated the procedure. There
                            should not be bloody aspirant, cyanosis, or bronchospasm. Check that
                            equipment is in good working order, frequency of procedure, etc.<br />

                            but also whether the resident eats the food and how the body uses it.
                            While the surveyor is not responsible for individual nutritional
                            assessments of residents, when specific information is needed during the
                            survey to make a compliance decision, the surveyor will utilize the
