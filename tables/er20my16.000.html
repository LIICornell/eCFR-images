Note 2 - Pitch, roll and yaw controller position versus force or time should be measured at the control. An alternative method in lieu of external test fixtures at the flight controls would be to have recording and measuring instrumentation built into the FSTD. The force and position data from this instrumentation could be directly recorded and matched to the airplane data. Provided the instrumentation was verified by using external measuring equipment while conducting the static control checks, or equivalent means, and that evidence of the satisfactory comparison is included in the MQTG, the instrumentation could be used for both initial and recurrent evaluations for the measurement of all required control checks. Verification of the instrumentation by using external measuring equipment should be repeated if major modifications and/or repairs are made to the control loading system. Such a permanent installation could be used without any time being lost for the installation of external devices. Static and dynamic flight control tests should be accomplished at the same feel or impact pressures as the validation data where applicable.<br />
Note 3 - FSTD static control testing from the second set of pilot controls is only required if both sets of controls are not mechanically interconnected on the FSTD. A rationale is required from the data provider if a single set of data is applicable to both sides. If controls are mechanically interconnected in the FSTD, a single set of tests is sufficient.</small></span></th>

Record the stall warning signal and initial buffet, if applicable. Time history data must be recorded for full stall through recovery to normal flight.
