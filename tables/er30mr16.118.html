Aerodynamic stall modeling that includes degradation in static/dynamic lateral-directional stability, degradation in control response (pitch, roll, and yaw), uncommanded roll response or roll-off requiring significant control deflection to counter, apparent randomness or non-repeatability, changes in pitch stability, Mach effects, and stall buffet, as appropriate to the aircraft type.<br /><br />
The aerodynamic model must incorporate an angle of attack and sideslip range to support the training tasks. At a minimum, the model must support an angle of attack range to ten degrees beyond the stall identification angle of attack. The stall identification angle of attack is defined as the point where the behavior of the airplane gives the pilot a clear and distinctive indication through the inherent flight characteristics or the characteristics resulting from the operation of a stall identification device (e.g., a stick pusher) that the airplane has stalled.<br /><br />
The model must be capable of capturing the variations seen in the stall characteristics of the airplane (e.g., the presence or absence of a pitch break, deterrent buffet, or other indications of a stall where present on the aircraft). The aerodynamic modeling must support stall training maneuvers in the following flight conditions:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>(1) Stall entry at wings level (1g);</li>
<li>(2) Stall entry in turning flight of at least 25&#176; bank angle (accelerated stall);</li>
<li>(3) Stall entry in a power-on condition (required only for propeller driven aircraft); and</li>
<li>(4) Aircraft configurations of second segment climb, high altitude cruise (near performance limited condition), and approach or landing.</li>
</ul><br />
A Statement of Compliance (SOC) is required which describes the aerodynamic modeling methods, validation, and checkout of the stall characteristics of the FSTD. The SOC must also include verification that the FSTD has been evaluated by a subject matter expert pilot acceptable to the FAA. See Attachment 7 of this Appendix for detailed requirements.<br /><br />
Where known limitations exist in the aerodynamic model for particular stall maneuvers (such as aircraft configurations and stall entry methods), these limitations must be declared in the required SOC.<br /><br />
FSTDs qualified for full stall training tasks must also meet the instructor operating station (lOS) requirements for upset prevention and recovery training (UPRT) tasks as described in section 2.n. of this table. See Attachment 7 of this Appendix for additional requirements.<br /><br />

<td headers="qps requirements">Upset Prevention and Recovery Training (UPRT).<br /><br />
Aerodynamics Evaluation: The simulator must be evaluated for specific upset recovery maneuvers for the purpose of determining that the combination of angle of attack and sideslip does not exceed the range of flight test validated data or wind tunnel/analytical data while performing the recovery maneuver.<br /><br />
The following minimum set of required upset recovery maneuvers must be evaluated in this manner and made available to the instructor/evaluator. Other upset recovery scenarios as developed by the FSTD sponsor must be evaluated in the same manner:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>(1) A nose-high, wings level aircraft upset;</li>
<li>(2) A nose-low aircraft upset; and</li>
<li>(3) A high bank angle aircraft upset.</li>
</ul><br />
Upset Scenarios: lOS selectable dynamic airplane upsets must provide guidance to the instructor concerning the method used to drive the FSTD into an upset condition, including any malfunction or degradation in the FSTD's functionality required to initiate the upset. The unrealistic degradation of simulator functionality (such as degrading flight control effectiveness) to drive an airplane upset is generally not acceptable unless used purely as a tool for repositioning the FSTD with the pilot out of the loop.<br /><br />
Instructor Operating System (lOS): The simulator must have a feedback mechanism in place to notify the instructor/evaluator when the simulator's validated aerodynamic envelope and aircraft operating limits have been exceeded during an upset recovery training task. This feedback mechanism must include:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>(1) FSTD validation envelope. This must be in the form of an alpha/beta envelope (or equivalent method) depicting the "confidence level" of the aerodynamic model depending on the degree of flight validation or source of predictive methods. The envelopes must provide the instructor real-time feedback on the simulation during a maneuver. There must be a minimum of a flaps up and flaps down envelope available;</li>
<li>(2) Flight control inputs. This must enable the instructor to assess the pilot's flight control displacements and forces (including fly-by-wire as appropriate); and</li>
<li>(3) Airplane operational limits. This must display the aircraft operating limits during the maneuver as applicable for the configuration of the airplane.</li>
</ul><br />
Statement of Compliance (SOC): An SOC is required that defines the source data used to construct the FSTD validation envelope. The SOC must also verify that each upset prevention and recovery feature programmed at the instructor station and the associated training maneuver has been evaluated by a suitably qualified pilot using methods described in this section. The statement must confirm that the recovery maneuver can be performed such that the FSTD does not exceed the FSTD validation envelope, or when exceeded, that it is within the realm of confidence in the simulation accuracy.

<li>â€¢ Pitch attitude greater than 10 degrees, nose down</li>
<li>â€¢ Bank angle greater than 45 degrees</li>
<li>â€¢ Flight at airspeeds inappropriate for conditions.</li>
</ul><br />
FSTDs used to conduct upset recovery maneuvers at angles of attack above the stall warning system activation must meet the requirements for high angle of attack modeling as described in section 2.m.<br /><br />
Special consideration should be given to the motion system response during upset prevention and recovery maneuvers. Notwithstanding the limitations of simulator motion, specific emphasis should be placed on tuning out motion system responses.<br /><br />
Consideration should be taken with flight envelope protected airplanes as artificially positioning the airplane to a specified attitude may incorrectly initialize flight control laws.<br /><br />
