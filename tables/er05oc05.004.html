    <ul>
      <li><em>Historical evidence</em> means the investigation: (1) found written documents or
        records, (2) documented interviews of persons with knowledge of site conditions, or (3)
        found and verified other forms of information.</li>
      <li><em>Physical evidence</em> means: (1) recorded observations from on-site investigations,
        such as finding intact UXO or DMM, or munitions debris (e.g., fragments, penetrators,
        projectiles, shell casings, links, fins); (2) the results of field or laboratory sampling
        and analysis procedures; or (3) the results of geophysical investigations.</li>
      <li><em>In the subsurface</em> means the munition (i.e., a DMM or UXO) is (1) entirely
        beneath the ground surface, or (2) fully submerged in a water body.</li>
      <li><em>On the surface</em> means the munition (i.e., a DMM or UXO) is (1) entirely or
        partially exposed above the ground surface (i.e., above the soil layer), or (2) entirely
        or partially exposed above the surface of a water body (e.g., as a result of tidal
        activity).</li>
      <li>The term <em>small arms ammunition</em> means ammunition, without projectiles that
        contain explosives (other than tracers), that is .50 caliber or smaller, or for
        shotguns.</li>
