			<span>B. A TIA is a type of cooperative agreement whenever its patent-rights provision
				complies with the Bayh-Dole statute (Chapter 18 of Title 35, U.S.C), as shown in the
				preceding table. The authority to award the TIA is 10 U.S.C. 2358, in addition to
				any program-specific statute that may provide authority to award cooperative
				agreements. The TIA also may use the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 to include a
				recovery of funds provision that requires the recipient, as a condition for
				receiving support under the agreement, to make payments to the Department of Defense
				or other Federal agency.</span>
