    <strong>Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Former</em> (as in &quot;former military range&quot;) means the MRS is a
            location that was (1) closed by a formal decision made by the Component with
            administrative control over the location, or (2) put to a use incompatible with the
            presence of UXO, DMM, or MC.</li>
        <li><em>Historical evidence</em> means the investigation: (1) found written
            documents or records, (2) documented interviews of persons with knowledge of site
            conditions, or (3) found and verified other forms of information.</li>
        <li><em>Physical evidence</em> means: (1) recorded observations from on-site
            investigations, such as finding intact UXO or DMM, or munitions debris (e.g., fragments,
            penetrators, projectiles, shell casings, links, fins); (2) the results of field or
            laboratory sampling and analysis procedures; or (3) the results of geophysical
            investigations.</li>
        <li><em>Practice munitions</em> means munitions that contain an inert filler
            (e.g., wax, sand, concrete), a spotting charge (i.e., a small charge of red phosphorus,
            photoflash powder, or black powder used to indicate the point of impact), and a
            fuze.</li>
        <li>The term <em>small arms ammunition</em> means ammunition, without projectiles
            that contain explosives (other than tracers), that is .50 caliber or smaller, or for
            shotguns.</li>
