			Evidence from studies using scientifically validated protocols with isolated human/animal tissues or
			other, non-tissue-based, though scientifically validated, protocols should be assessed. Examples o f,
			scientifically validated test methods for identifying eve corrosives and severe irritants (i.e.. Serious Eve
			Damage) include OECD TG 437 (Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP)) and TG 438 (Isolated Chicken
			Eve).
			Positive test results from a scientifically validated in vitro test for skin corrosion would likely also
			lead to
			a conclusion to classify as causing Serious Eye Damage.

		<span>Measurement of pH alone may be adequate, but assessment of acid or alkali reserve (buffering capacity)
			would be preferable.</span>

	<div class="footnote grid">
		<span><sup>6</sup></span>
		<span>All information that is available on a chemical should be considered and an overall determination made on
			the total weight of evidence. This is especially true when there is conflict in information available on
			some parameters. The weight of evidence including information on skin irritation could lead to
			classification of eve irritation. It is recognized that not all skin irritants are eye irritants as well.
			Professional judgment should be exercised in making such a determination.</span>
