		<span class="footnote">Notes:<br />

			A. Assign a person designated under § 213.7 to visually supervise each operation over the defective
			rail.<br />

			A2. Assign a person designated under § 213.7 to make a visual inspection. After a visual inspection, that
			person
			may authorize operation to continue without continuous visual supervision at a maximum of 10 m.p.h. for up
			to 24
			hours prior to another such visual inspection or replacement or repair of the rail.<br />

			B. Limit operating speed over the defective rail to that as authorized by a person designated under §
			213.7(a), who has at least one year of supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance. The
			operating speed cannot be over 30 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed under § 213.9 for the class of
			track concerned, whichever is lower.<br />

			C. Apply joint bars bolted only through the outermost holes to the defect within 10 days after it is
			determined to continue the track in use. In the case of Class 3 through 5 track, limit the operating
			speed over the defective rail to 30 m.p.h. until joint bars are applied; thereafter, limit the speed to
			50 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed under § 213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is
			lower. When a search for internal rail defects is conducted under § 213.237, and defects are discovered
			in Class 3 through 5 track that require remedial action C, the operating speed shall be limited to 50
			m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed under § 213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is
			lower, for a period not to exceed 4 days. If the defective rail has not been removed from the track or a
			permanent repair made within 4 days of the discovery, limit operating speed over the defective rail to
			30 m.p.h. until joint bars are applied; thereafter, limit speed to 50 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable
			speed under § 213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower. When joint bars have not been
			applied within 10 days, the speed must be limited to 10 m.p.h. until joint bars are applied.<br />

			D. Apply joint bars bolted only through the outermost holes to the defect within 7 days after it is
			determined to continue the track in use. In the case of Class 3 through 5 track, limit operating speed
			over the defective rail to 30 m.p.h. or less as authorized by a person designated under § 213.7(a), who
			has at least one year of supervisory experience in railroad track maintenance, until joint bars are
			applied; thereafter, limit speed to 50 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed under § 213.9 for the class
			of track concerned, whichever is lower. When joint bars have not been applied within 7 days, the speed
			must be limited to 10 m.p.h. until the joint bars are applied.<br />

			E. Apply joint bars to the defect and bolt in accordance with § 213.121(d) and (e).<br />

			F. Inspect the rail within 90 days after it is determined to continue the track in use. If the rail
			remains in the track and is not replaced or repaired, the reinspection cycle starts over with each
			successive reinspection unless the

			reinspection reveals the rail defect to have increased in size and therefore become subject to a more
			restrictive
			remedial action. This process continues indefinitely until the rail is removed from the track or repaired.
			If
			not inspected within 90 days, limit speed to that for Class 2 track or the maximum allowable speed under §
			213.9
			for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower, until it is inspected.<br />

			G. Inspect rail within 30 days after it is determined to continue the track in use. If the rail remains
			in the track and is not replaced or repaired, the reinspection cycle starts over with each successive
			reinspection unless the reinspection reveals the rail defect to have increased in size and therefore
			become subject to a more restrictive remedial action. This process continues indefinitely until the rail
			is removed from the track or repaired. If not inspected within 30 days, limit speed to that for Class 2
			track or the maximum allowable speed under § 213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower,
			until it is inspected.<br />

			H. Limit operating speed over the defective rail to 50 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed under §
			213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower.<br />

			I. Limit operating speed over the defective rail to 30 m.p.h. or the maximum allowable speed under §
			213.9 for the class of track concerned, whichever is lower.</span>
