				<li>The term <em>CWM/UXO</em> means CWM that are UXO.</li>
				<li>The notation <em>CWM/DMM</em> means CWM that are DMM, to include CAIS K941,

					site conditions, or (3) found and verified other forms of information.</li>
				<li><em>Physical evidence</em> means: (1) recorded observations from on-site
					investigations, such as finding intact UXO or DMM, or munitions debris (e.g.,
					fragments, penetrators, projectiles, shell casings, links, fins); (2) the
