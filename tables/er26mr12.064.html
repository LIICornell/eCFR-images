			Pre-existing animal data (e.g. from an acute dermal toxicity test or a sensitisation test) should he
			carefully reviewed to determine if sufficient skin corrosion/irritation evidence is available through other,
			similar information. For example, classification/categorization may he done on the basis of whether a
			chemical has or has not produced any skin irritation in an acute dermal toxicity test in animals at the
			limit dose, or produces very toxic effects in an acute dermal toxicity test in animals.
			In the latter case, the chemical would he classified as being very hazardous by the dermal route for
			acute toxicity, and it would be moot whether the chemical is also irritating or corrosive on the skin.
			It should be kept in mind in evaluating acute dermal toxicity information that the reporting of dermal
			lesions may he incomplete, testing and observations may he made on a species other than the rabbit, and
			species may differ in sensitivity in their responses.

			Evidence from studies using scientifically validated protocols with isolated human/animal
			tissues or other, non-tissue-based, though scientifically validated, protocols should he assessed.
			Examples of scientifically validated test methods for skin corrosion include OECD TG 430 (Transcutaneous
			Electrical Resistance Test (TER)), 431 (Human Skin Model Test), and 435 (Membrane Barrier Test Method).
			OECD TG 439 (Reconstructed Human Epidermis Test Method) is a scientifically validated in vitro test
			method for skin irritation.

			Measurement of pH alone may be adequate, but assessment of acid or alkali reserve (buffering
			capacity) would be preferable. Presently, there is no scientifically validated and internationally
			accepted method for assessing this parameter.

			All information that is available on a chemical should he considered and an overall
			determination made on the total weight of evidence. This is especially true when there is conflict in
			information available on some parameters. Professional judgment should be exercised in making such a
			determination.
