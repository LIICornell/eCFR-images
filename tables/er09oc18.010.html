                fishing by particular gear types, bounded by lines specifically defined by latitude
                and longitude coordinates set out at §§ 660.71-660.74. This RCA is not defined by
                depth contours (with the exception of the 20-fm depth contour boundary south of 42
                N. lat.), and the boundary lines that define the RCA may close areas that are deeper
                or shallower than the depth contour. Vessels that are subject to RCA restrictions
                may not fish in the RCA, or operate in the RCA for any purpose other than
                transiting.</div>
